            Multiple counties across Pennsylvania have certified the results of the election,
            <br> as the process of cementing the results in the state continues despite some <br>
            scattered efforts by local Republicans to halt the process <br>

Philadelphia, the largest county in the state and where Mr. Biden built his biggest margin, <br>

“Despite all the meritless litigation and misinformation targeting our electoral system, I’m proud <br>
 that the birthplace of our Republic held the most transparent and secure election in the history of <br>

  on Twitter.

In Allegheny County, the second largest county in the state and home to Pittsburgh, the board voted 2–1
<br> to certify the results, with Sam Demarco, the lone Republican member, voting against. Mr. DeMarco said <br>
 his vote was an attempt to spur action in the state capital to make changes to the state’s voting laws, The <br>
  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.

In Luzerne County, which Mr. Trump won by more than 14,000 votes, the board certified the results in a 3–2 vote, <br>
 again with the Democratic members of the board voting to certify and the two Republicans voting against.
